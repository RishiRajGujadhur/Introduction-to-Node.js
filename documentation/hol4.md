# Introduction to Node.js
# HOL4 – Unit testing
## Description
We are now ready to test the API you created in lab 3. In fact, we could/should have created these tests BEFORE we developed the API. But as it wouldn’t have made much sense from a learning perspective we’ll make the tests after developed the API.
You are now going to make four tests: 

**1. Get all products**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should execute without errors*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return an http status 200*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return three items*  

**2. Get product with id = 3**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should execute without errors*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return an http status 200*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return "Dajm"*  

**3. Add one product**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should execute without errors*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return an http status 200*  

**4. Get all products again**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should execute without errors*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return an http status 200*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;*should return four items*
