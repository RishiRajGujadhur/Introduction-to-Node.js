# Introduction to Node.js
# HOL4 – Working with data
## Description
MongoDB is one of the most commonly used databases for Node.js, and during this lab we are going to move the static **products** collection to one in MongoDB. Preceding this exercise, you should have MongoDB installed, but before we start you’ll need to do some setup.
## Before you begin
* Create a folder called *MongoDBLab*
* Open the MongoDB installation folder and browse the bin folder (*C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin on Windows*)
* Copy all files to the folder you created in step 1
* In the *MongoDBLab* folder, create a new directory called data.
* Open a console/terminal and browse to the *MongoDBLab* folder
* Type **mongod -dbpath ./data --httpinterface –rest** and hit ENTER

You should now have MongoDB server started and you should be able to browse to http://localhost:28017/ using your favorite browser.
