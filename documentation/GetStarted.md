# Introduction to Node.js
# Getting started
Welcome to this *Introduction to Node.js* course. Before we begin you need to install and familiarize yourself with the tools we’re are going to use throughout this course.
##Install tools
###Node.js
Browse to https://nodejs.org and download and install the latest version of Node.js. Once installed, you should be able to run Node by opening a command prompt/terminal and type “node”. You are now in node, and can start typing JavaScript! Try typing “console.log('Hello from Node.js')” to verify it works. You can exit by closing the terminal or by hitting CTRL+C.
